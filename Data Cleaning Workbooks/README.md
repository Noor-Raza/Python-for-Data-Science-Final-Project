### Data Cleaning  

These notebooks focus on cleaning and preprocessing data for better analysis. Below are the steps we followed for each dataset:

### Key Steps  

1. **Importing Dataset**  
   - Loaded the raw dataset into the notebook using `pandas`.

2. **Inspecting the DataFrame**  
   - Examined the structure of the data using methods like `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()`.  
   - Gained insights into the data types, column values, and overall quality of the dataset.

3. **Cleaning the Dataset**  
   - **a) Sorting the Dataset**  
     - Organized the data based on specific columns for easier analysis.  
   - **b) Identifying and Removing Duplicate Rows**  
     - Checked for duplicate entries and removed them to ensure data accuracy.  
   - **c) Visualizing the Dataset to Identify Outliers**  
     - Created visualizations to detect potential outliers in the dataset.  
   - **d) Removing Outliers**  
     - Applied techniques to filter out extreme values that could skew the analysis.  
   - **e) Imputing Missing Values**  
     - Handled missing data using appropriate imputation strategies.

4. **Exporting the Cleaned Dataset**  
   - Saved the cleaned dataset to a file for future use.
