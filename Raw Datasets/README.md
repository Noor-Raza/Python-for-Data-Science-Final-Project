### Raw Dataset  

This folder contains raw datasets for 10 companies.

---

### Key Information

1. Each company's data is stored in a `.csv` file.
2. These files are the starting point for cleaning and preparing the data.
3. We will use Python and the `pandas` library to read these files and clean the data.
4. We then save and export cleaned .csv files for each company's dataset to another folder.
